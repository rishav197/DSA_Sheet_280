# LinkedList - Problems

S.No. | Problem | Approach/Logic used | Level | Link | Solution |
------|---------|---------------------|-------|------|----------|
1 | Middle of the Linked List | Just iterate over the list till n/2 length of the given linkedlist and then return "tmp" pointer | Easy | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/) | [view](middle-of-the-LL.cpp) 
2 | Linked List cycle | floyd's aglo or Hare and Tortoise algo(keep two pointers are slow and fast, slow increment once whereas fast increment twice). if they will match (slow==fast) then there must be a cycle | Easy | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description/) | [view](LL-cycle.cpp) 
3 | Convert Binary num in a Linked list to integer |  | Easy | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-binary-number-in-a-linked-list-to-integer/description/) | [view](Convert-binary-num-to-decimal.cpp) 
4 | Remove Duplicates from Sorted List |  | Easy | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/) | [view](remove-dups-from-sorted-lst.cpp) 
7 | Merge Two Sorted Lists | first create a dummyNode then add smaller num of the two current LL nodes next to the dummyNode then finally return dummyNode->next(head of the final node) | Easy | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/description/) | [view](mergeTwoSortedLst.cpp) 
11 | Palindrome Linked List | approach: stores the original list and its reversed list in two diff strings then compares two strings then return true if string and its reversed string equal else return false | Easy | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/description/) | [view](palindrome-LL.cpp)
12 | Reverse Linked List | Recursive approach - change first link b/w first and second node and rest recursion will take care | Easy | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/description/) | [view](reverse-LL.cpp) 
13 | addTwoNums | fixed approach keep a carry variable and assign digits and carries in new linkedlist as digit=value%10 and carry=value/10 | Medium | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/) | [view](addTwoNums.cpp)
15 | addTwoNums-II | firstly, reverse given lists l1 and l2 then apply same logic similiar to problem13 and then return reversed final list l3 | Medium | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers-ii/description/) | [view](addTwoNums-II.cpp)
17 | Reorder List | first we broke the list to the mid such that we'll get two lists and then reverse the second list. finally, adding nodes one by one from list1 and then list2 to dummyNode repeat it till end of these lists. dummyNode->next become the head of Reordered list | Medium | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/description/) | [view](reorder-list.cpp)
19 | Remove Nth Node from End of the list | approach: just traverse over the list till preceeding node to the (len-N+1)th node and change the next of the preceeding element to the next to next node | Medium | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/description/) | [view](remove-Nth-Node-EOL.cpp)
21 | Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II | approach: using hashmap | Medium | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list-ii/description/) | [view](remove-dups-from-sorted-lst-II.cpp)
23 | Sort List | store all elements of the given list in a vector and then sort the vector then copy values from sorted vector to original list | Medium | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/description/) | [view](sortList.cpp)
24 | Segregate even and odd nodes in a Linked List | approach: using two list of odds and evens then copy them into original Linked List | Medium | [view](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/segregate-even-and-odd-nodes-in-a-linked-list5035/1) | [view](segregate-even-odd-nodes-in-LL.cpp)
25 | Reorder List | same approach as problem no.-17 | Medium | [view](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-a-given-linked-list-in-place/) | [view](reorder-list-gfg.cpp)
26 | merge k Sorted Lists | approach: using a helper merge function for merging two lists at a time | Hard | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/description/) | [view](merge-k-sorted-lsts.cpp)
27 | reverse Nodes in K groups |  | Hard | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/description/) | [view](reverseNodes-in-K-grps.cpp)
