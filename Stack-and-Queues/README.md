# Stack & Queues - Problems

S.No. | Problem | Approach/Logic used | Level | Link | Solution |
------|---------|---------------------|-------|------|----------|
1 | Implement Queue using Stacks | Approach: using 2 stacks and costly deQueue operation | Easy | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/description/) | [view](Q-using-stacks.cpp) 
2 | Backspace String Compare LC-884 | using two stacks and iterate over given strings one by one whenever '#' is encounter there would be pop operation else the char added to the stack. After iterating the strings, start poping out the chars till stacks gets empty to store in two diff strings and then compare if both are equal then return true else return false | Easy | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/description/) | [view](backspace-str-comp.cpp) 
3 | Implement Stack using queues | Approach: using 2 queues and costly enQueue operation | Easy | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/description/) | [view](stack-using-queues.cpp) 
4 | Implement Stack and Queue using Deque | Approach: using Deque's operations like push_back(), pop_front() and pop_back() | Easy | [view](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implement-stack-queue-using-deque/) | [view](implement-stack-queue-using-deque.cpp) 
5 | Next greater element-I | Approach: using a Stack and undordered map. Iterate from right to left in nums2[] , pop elements till curr ele smaller than st.top(),if stack isn't empty then map curr with st.top() else map with -1 and add the curr ele to the stack ![image-1](https://github.com/rishav197/DSA_Sheet_280/blob/main/Stack-and-Queues/images/img5.jpg) | Easy | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/description/) | [view](nxt-gtr-element-I.cpp) 
6 | Evaluation of Postfix Expression | using one stack and iterating over the given postfix expression from right to left char by char | Easy | [view](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/evaluation-of-postfix-expression1735/1?utm_source=gfg&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=bottom_sticky_on_article) | [view](Eval-Of-Postfix-express.cpp) 
7 | Implement two stacks in an array | approach: smiliar to implementation of stack using an array. So, in this ques we have to apply same logic at start and end of the array | Easy | [view](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/implement-two-stacks-in-an-array/1?utm_source=gfg&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=bottom_sticky_on_article) | [view](implement-two-stacks-in-an-arr.cpp) 
11 | Online Stock Span | approach: using a stack of pairs (price,span). if curr price is less than or equal to top of the stack's price then start popping out pairs and add their spans (span+=st.top().first). Now, add the curr (price,span) to the stack and return span count | Medium | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/description/) | [view](Online-stock-span.cpp) 
14 | Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation | approach: using one stack and iterating over the given prefix array from left to right ![image-14_1](https://github.com/rishav197/DSA_Sheet_280/blob/main/Stack-and-Queues/images/img14_1.jpg) ![image-14_2](https://github.com/rishav197/DSA_Sheet_280/blob/main/Stack-and-Queues/images/img14_2.jpg)| Medium | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/description/) | [view](rev-polish-notation.cpp)
