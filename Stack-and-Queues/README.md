# Stack & Queues - Problems

S.No. | Problem | Approach/Logic used | Level | Link | Solution |
------|---------|---------------------|-------|------|----------|
1 | Implement Queue using Stacks | Approach: using 2 stacks and costly deQueue operation | Easy | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/description/) | [view](Q-using-stacks.cpp) 
2 | Backspace String Compare LC-884 | using two stacks and iterate over given strings one by one whenever '#' is encounter there would be pop operation else the char added to the stack. After iterating the strings, start poping out the chars till stacks gets empty to store in two diff strings and then compare if both are equal then return true else return false | Easy | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/description/) | [view](backspace-str-comp.cpp) 
3 | Implement Stack using queues | Approach: using 2 queues and costly enQueue operation | Easy | [view](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/description/) | [view](stack-using-queues.cpp) 
6 | Evaluation of Postfix Expression | using one stack and iterating over the given postfix expression from Left to Right char by char | Easy | [view](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/evaluation-of-postfix-expression1735/1?utm_source=gfg&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=bottom_sticky_on_article) | [view](Eval-Of-Postfix-express.cpp)
